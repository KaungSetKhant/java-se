//Types of variables - local,global(instant variable or non-static variable),static variable)

//int a = 12;//local variable (on one can't use)

//int a = 45;//global variable (everyone can use that)

// variable must not give same name but variables are local and global, can give same name of variables

// v is variable

// f is field

// m is method

// if you click "." behind variable, if appear something that is object

// static variable, class name or data type but no need to build object

// if you want to use instant variable, must build object

//Syntax for object create
//ClassName or dataType
//object ot object Name or variable
// new keyword
//Constructor name or Class name with curly brace

// var obj = OOP_Introduction() (In Kotlin)

// new OOP_Introduction() <---object

// OOP_Introduction() <---constructor

//OOP is Object-Oriented Programming - Java
//Functional Programming - Javascript and PHP
//Procedual Programming


//Class - like an interface of objects

//Object - known an object and can touch it

//Inheritance - parent and child

//Polymorphism - do a work but a work to do way is many
// (e.g. must search information is "a work" and browser search and dictionary search are "various way to do a work)

//Abstraction - must know the important things and may know the unimportant things
// (e.g. you don't know behind the things) or show user important functions

//Encapsulation - example of medicine interface or also known as model (MVC, MVP, MVVM)


//return types methodName(parameter){ implementation }

//return types --->void, byte, short, int, long, classname (return types==data types)
